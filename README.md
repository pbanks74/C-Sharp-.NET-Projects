### Blackjack Game
This console application has all the functionality and logic of your traditional game of blackjack allowing you to risk it all against the dealer. Logic compares user scores with dealer scores and calculates winnings. Exception handling is included to account for user input of negative values. Currently inplemented for one player but logic allows for multiple.

### Car Insurance Quote
This ASP.NET Core application uses MVC to arrange the layout. Web application allows a user to fill out a form and it calculates a car insurance quote while providing basic CRUD / Admin functionality.

### Package Express
Console application that accepts user input to calculate shipping costs based on the dimensions and weight of a package. Logic included to prompt user if package is too large/heavy to ship.
